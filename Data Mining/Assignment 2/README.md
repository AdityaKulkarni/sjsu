# Exploring Generative AI

This repository contains the assignment work for assignment 1: Exploring Generative AI. The `workspace` directory contains all the output generated from gpt-engineer. The screencast is in `Assignment 2 Screencast.7z` (had to compress it because of github file upload size restriction).

## About the project

I used gpt-engineer to create a react app which displays weather of any city. I used [weatherapi](https://www.weatherapi.com/)'s API endpoint for this project.

## Pain Points

-   We need to be as much clear as possible with the prompt we provide to gpt-engineer. Even then, it will always have a few questions which we can choose to answer or skip. If we skip, it'll make assumptions of its's own.
-   The code generated by gpt-engineer is not guaranteed to run. We need to make substantial changes before we can show any substantial output.
-   While gpt-engineer is suited for generating boilerplate code for small applications, it takes much more efforts to use it for generating full projects. For example, in this assignment although it created necessary component files, it did not maintain the ReactJS project directory structure, did not create a public index.html file which is a required file for ReactJS project, etc.

# Conclusion

AI-generated code expedites project setup, yet achieving tangible results necessitates additional human effort and refinement.
