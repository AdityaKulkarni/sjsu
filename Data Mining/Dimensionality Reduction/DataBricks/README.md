## Dimensionality Reduction using DataBricks

DataBricks has a package called ```databricks_test_helper``` which can be used to perform testing on various aspects in our notebook.

For example, for a dataset, we can test if the mean values are equal to or close to the expected mean values etc. There are many other functions included in the test helper such as
- ```check_basis```
- ```isinstance```
- ```entry```
- ```sum_every_other```
- ```sum_by_two```

  These methods make it very eash to test our output against the expected values of our analysis.
